# Patterns in Bike Sharing Data

## Background
<br>

Citi Bike is the nation's largest bike sharing program, with 12,000 bikes and 750 stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn,
and Queens. 
It was designed for quick trips with convenience, also a fun and affordable way to get around town.
As a tranportation system, bike sharing is ideally designed for densely populated cities like New York. 
Importantly, bike sharing offers options for economic growth and job creation, as well as providing considerable health benefits.

## Data
<br>

We download files of Citi Bike trip data in 2014. The data includes:
* Trip Duration (seconds)
* Start Time and Date
* Stop Time and Date
* Start Station Name
* End Station Name
* Station ID
* Station Lat/Long
* Bike ID
* User Type (Customer = 24 hour pass or 3-day pass user; Subscriber = Annual Member)
* Gender (0 = unknown; 1 = male; 2 = female)
* Year of Birth

<br>

This data has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, and any trips 
that were below 60 seconds in length.
Other demographic information, such as race/ethnicity, income and educational status may also impact bicycly use, but the data 
available does not allow this report to explore these factors.

## Analysis
<br>

And we plan to analyze data in the following aspects:
* Usage in each month for year 2014
* Distribution of total usage in each hour on week and weekend in July and December
* Distribution of trip duration in different parts of time on week and weekend in July and December
* Age and gender proportion of bike users
* Plot maps of every station and usage distribution
